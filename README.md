# Scheme Switching with Fault Tolerance README

## Introduction

This repo contains the implementation of a scheme-switching idea where a Secure Aggregation's (SA) aggregator key is converted to a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) ciphertext in OpenFHE. The primary goal of this project is to allow scheme switching of SA ciphertexts to FHE to allow for homomorphic evaluations on SA ciphertexts.


## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a modern C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later.
- **CMake**: Build system generator (version 3.10 or later).
- **OpenFHE Library**: For homomorphic encryption operations.
- **Standard Libraries**: Standard libraries for image processing and mathematical computations.

## Installation

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/n7koirala/scheme_switch.git
    cd scheme_switch
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed:
    - OpenFHE
    - CMake
    - Standard C++ libraries

3. **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

## Usage

To run the application, run the executable under the build folder:
```bash
./build/sa_to_fhe
```

### Parameters

Currently, the parameters have been configured to run for 5 parties where one of the parties can fault (drop out).
The application can be configured using various parameters defined in the source code. Key parameters include:

- **Multiplicative Depth**: Set the depth of multiplicative operations.
- **Scaling Mod Size**: Configure the size for scaling modulus.
- **Batch Size**: Determine the batch size for encoding parameters.

### Example Configuration

```cpp
CCParams<CryptoContextCKKSRNS> parameters;
parameters.SetMultiplicativeDepth(6);
parameters.SetScalingModSize(40);
parameters.SetBatchSize(32768);
```
